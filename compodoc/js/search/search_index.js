Имеет широкие возможности      для кастомизации: пользовательские темы, сочетания клавиш и файлы конфигурации. Распространяется бесплатно, разрабатывается      как программное обеспечение с открытым исходным кодом          Выводы по главе        В данной главе был проведён анализ предметной области, было проведено сравнение аналогов, что помогло лучше понять основные      требования к приложению. Далее был произведён выбор языка программирования и среды программирования, выбор был основан      на результатах анализа наиболее значимых представителей и соотнесения их особенностей с поставленной задачей, а именно      созданием Web-приложения. Также были расписаны основные функциональные требования к приложению.
